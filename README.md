The development process for HyperTask involved pleanty of reserach into React Native and connecting a MySQL server, during which I had the opportunity to deeply analyze the code and relate it to my current understanding of React.

The app interface is designed with React Native Elements, a Cross Platform React Native UI toolkit. While to SQL server is a localhost server, currently running two tables, User and Tasks.
